## ðŸŽ“Overview

BlinkQUIZ is a web application for all kinds of users including **Blind Users**. Users can simply log in to be able to create and join quizzes by sharing the quiz code. There might be lots of quiz-generating applications, but the idea of creating a quiz and then taking it on the same platform and evaluating the students in such an amazingly easier way is quite innovative, where a teacher will create a quiz and have control over its shareability and access. Upon enabling public access, the app will provide a unique and secure quiz code that can be shared with students. Quiz code will be used by students to join the quiz and to avoid anonymous spamming entries. A list of students and their marks in respective quizzes will be shared with the creator/ teacher of the quiz.
